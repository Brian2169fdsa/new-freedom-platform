## Models
This section contains all the Zod-defined schemas for database models and request/response
objects.

## Data
Database models defined here. These models will be used to validate any data going in
or out of the database. Define them as tightly as possible.

## Request
Request and response models defined here. They are used to validate incoming request data
structures and define the correct response structure for Typescript.
